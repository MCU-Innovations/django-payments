Universal payment handling for Django

Django integration for receiving payments with different payment providers.
Includes backends with support for a few payment providers, and is also usable
with `community-maintained backends for additional providers
<https://django-payments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends.html#community-backends>`_.

See the full documentation at https://django-payments.readthedocs.org/ for
details.
